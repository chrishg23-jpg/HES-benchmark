Introduction

The nature of spacetime remains one of the deepest puzzles in theoretical physics. While General Relativity describes gravity as curvature in a geometric manifold, and Quantum Mechanics governs the probabilistic behavior of particles, a unified framework that explains how spacetime itself emerges from quantum principles remains elusive.

Recent advances in quantum information theory suggest that entanglement may play a foundational role in the emergence of spacetime geometry. The idea that “geometry is entanglement” has gained traction—but concrete, reproducible models remain rare.

This paper introduces a toy model based on the Holographic Entropic Spacetime (HES) framework, where curvature arises from entropy gradients in a discrete lattice of microstates. The model simulates how local entropic interactions and global feedback dynamics can generate stable geometric structure without invoking mass or classical fields.

We present a reproducible benchmark notebook that visualizes this process, offering a hands-on demonstration of how information structure alone can give rise to curvature. The results support the hypothesis that spacetime may be a macroscopic manifestation of underlying entropic dynamics—and open new avenues for exploring emergent gravity from first principles.

To deepen this investigation, we developed a sequence of modular simulations that visualize directional curvature emergence from entropy gradients. These animations reveal how curvature forms, propagates, and accumulates memory within the lattice, offering a diagnostic lens on the dynamics of entropic geometry. Each simulation isolates a distinct regime—from static curvature hotspots to oscillatory expansion zones, from persistent curvature memory to entropy-driven attractor formation. Together, they provide empirical support for the HES framework and offer a reproducible visual narrative of emergent spacetime structure.

Theoretical Framework

The Holographic Entropic Spacetime (HES) framework proposes that spacetime curvature emerges from gradients in entanglement entropy across a discrete lattice of quantum microstates. Rather than treating geometry as a fundamental entity, HES models it as a macroscopic manifestation of underlying informational structure.

Each site in the lattice represents a quantum microstate. The system evolves by minimizing a fundamental Informational Action `\( \mathcal{A} \)`.

---

Local Entropic Dynamics: The Entanglement Analogue

Entropy quantifies the local informational tension. In this simplified classical toy model, we use the Shannon entropy as an analogue for the quantum Von Neumann entropy.

The local entropy at site `\( (x, y) \)` is defined as:

S(x, y) = - \sum_i p_i(x, y) \log p_i(x, y)


where `\( p_i(x, y) \)` is the probability distribution over microstates in the local neighborhood of `\( (x, y) \)`.

---

Global Feedback Stabilization: The Informational Action

The system’s evolution minimizes the total Informational Action `\( \mathcal{A} \)`, which combines the summed entropic density `\( S \)` and a stabilizing global feedback term `\( E_{\text{global}} \)`:

\mathcal{A}(t) = \sum_{x,y} S(x, y, t) + E_{\text{global}}(t)


The global feedback term suppresses vacuum energy fluctuations, acting as a damping mechanism:

E_{\text{global}}(t) = \gamma \left( \sum_{x,y} S(x, y, t) \right)^2


where `\( \gamma \)` is a tunable damping coefficient.

---

Curvature from Entropy: The Ricci Analogue

To extract curvature, we apply a discrete Laplacian operator `\( \nabla^2 \)` to the entropy field `\( S(x, y) \)`, yielding a curvature map `\( C(x, y) \)`:

C(x, y) = \nabla^2 S(x, y)


In this two-dimensional discrete lattice, `\( C(x, y) \)` serves as a direct analogue for the Ricci scalar `\( R \)`, demonstrating that geometry bends due to entropic structure.

---

Dynamical Update Rule (Key for Reproducibility)

The system evolves iteratively toward minimizing the total Informational Action `\( \mathcal{A} \)` using a stochastic dynamics approach (e.g., Metropolis-Hastings). At each time step, a random site’s microstate is proposed to flip `\( \mu \to \mu' \)`, and the change in action `\( \Delta \mathcal{A} \)` is computed.

The probability `\( P \)` of accepting the flip is:

P(\mu \to \mu') = \min \left( 1, \exp \left( -\frac{\Delta \mathcal{A}}{T} \right) \right)


where `\( T \)` is the effective informational temperature, held constant to simulate low-energy equilibrium.



Results and Interpretation

The HES benchmark simulation produces four key outputs: the evolving microstate lattice, the entropy map, the curvature map, and a time-series analysis of global entropy and energy. Together, these results illustrate how entropic structure alone can generate stable curvature in a discrete spacetime model.

1. Microstate Lattice Evolution

The initial lattice consists of randomly assigned microstates, representing a high-entropy, disordered configuration. As the simulation progresses, local entropic interactions and global feedback dynamics smooth the lattice, driving it toward equilibrium.


![Figure 1: Microstate Lattice Evolution](Figures/Figure_1.PNG)
Figure 1: Microstate Lattice Evolution

The system transitions from a high-entropy, disordered state to a smooth, stable configuration through local entropic interactions and global feedback.

Interpretation:
This evolution demonstrates that local entropy gradients can self-organize into coherent structure. The system stabilizes without external constraints, suggesting that informational dynamics alone can produce order.

---

2. Entropy Map


The entropy map visualizes the distribution of local entanglement across the lattice. High-entropy regions appear as smooth gradients, while low-entropy zones reflect equilibrium or alignment.

![Figure 2: Entropy Map](Figures/Figure_2.PNG)
Figure 2: Entropy Map

Entropy gradients reveal hidden structure in the lattice. High entropy regions indicate strong local entanglement; low entropy regions reflect equilibrium.

Interpretation:
Entropy acts as a proxy for informational connectivity. The emergence of smooth gradients indicates that entanglement structure can encode geometric features, supporting the hypothesis that spacetime may be woven from entropic relationships.

---

3. Curvature Map

Applying a discrete Laplacian to the entropy field yields a curvature map. This map reveals how entropy gradients bend the lattice geometry, producing warps and folds without invoking mass or classical fields.

![Figure 3: Curvature Map](Figures/Figure_3.PNG)
Figure 3: Curvature Map

Applying a Laplacian operator to the entropy map yields emergent curvature. Geometry bends in response to information structure, not mass.

Interpretation:
Curvature emerges directly from entropy. This result aligns with the idea that spacetime geometry is not fundamental, but emergent from deeper informational principles. The model provides a concrete, reproducible demonstration of this concept.

---

4. Time-Series Analysis

The simulation tracks global entropy and energy over time. Entropy stabilizes early, indicating equilibrium, while global energy exhibits damped oscillations due to feedback dynamics.

![Figure 4: Time-Series Analysis](Figures/Figure_4.PNG)
Figure 4: Time-Series Analysis

Entropy stabilizes early, indicating equilibrium. Global energy oscillates due to feedback dynamics, revealing the system’s self-regulating behavior.

Interpretation:
The system self-regulates through entropic feedback. The early stabilization of entropy suggests that equilibrium geometry can emerge quickly, while energy oscillations reflect the interplay between local structure and global constraints.

Theory Integration: From Entanglement to Observable Laws

The HES framework offers a unified narrative for how the universe we observe—and the laws we derive from it—emerge from microscopic entanglement dynamics and are regulated by holographic constraints. Below, we outline how key physical phenomena arise naturally within this model.

Mass as Informational Tension

Mass emerges as a statistical effect of localized entanglement gradients. Regions of steep entropy imbalance behave as informational tension zones, curving the emergent geometry in a manner analogous to the stress-energy tensor in General Relativity. These zones stabilize the lattice by resisting expansion, effectively modeling mass without invoking particles.

Gravity as Entropic Equilibrium

Spacetime curvature reflects the distribution of entropic forces across the microstate ensemble. Gravity is not a fundamental force but a statistical tendency toward equilibrium in entanglement entropy. The HES rulebook drives the system to minimize entanglement gradients, reproducing gravitational behavior as a thermodynamic effect.

Quantum Mechanics and Coherence

The UV layer of the framework is governed by quantum entanglement dynamics. Microstates evolve to maximize mutual information, forming coherent clusters that encode proto-geometric patches. This behavior mirrors quantum superposition and entanglement, suggesting that spacetime itself is a macroscopic expression of quantum coherence.


The Cosmological Constant as Statistical Residue

The observed cosmological constant arises as a residual imbalance in the global entanglement ledger. HES sequesters expansive vacuum energy into boundary-encoded degrees of freedom, driving the net vacuum energy toward zero. The remaining fluctuation behaves like dark energy, naturally suppressed by the ratio `\( (H_0 t_P)^2 \)` without fine-tuning.

Casimir Effect and Boundary Entropy

Boundary constraints in the microstate lattice suppress entropy fluctuations, producing measurable forces akin to the Casimir effect. These forces arise from the statistical exclusion of high-energy modes near entropic boundaries, offering an entropic interpretation of vacuum pressure.

Black Holes as Holographic Ledgers

Black holes are modeled as maximal entanglement sinks—regions where expansive microstates are sequestered into high-entropy, non-geometric degrees of freedom. These regions encode infalling information on their boundaries, acting as holographic ledgers that stabilize the global entanglement balance. This aligns with the fuzzball picture and the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula.

Regulation of Physical Laws

The laws of physics emerge as statistical regularities within the entanglement dynamics. Conservation laws, causal structure, and geometric symmetries are not imposed but arise from the self-organizing behavior of the microstate ensemble. HES provides a regulatory mechanism that maintains these laws across scales via holographic feedback.



3D modeling

Model Architecture

The Holographic Entropic Spacetime (HES) model operates on a discrete 3D lattice of scalar microstates, denoted by a field `\( s(x, y, z, t) \)`. Each point in the lattice evolves according to a Laplacian-driven update rule, with local entropy gradients and global feedback shaping the dynamics.

At each timestep, the scalar field is updated via:

s_{t+1} = s_t + \alpha \nabla^2 s_t - \beta s_t - \gamma \langle s_t \rangle

where:

• `\( \nabla^2 s_t \)` is the discrete Laplacian of the scalar field,
• `\( \langle s_t \rangle \)` is the global mean entropy,
• `\( \alpha \)` controls local diffusion,
• `\( \beta \)` damps local entropy,
• `\( \gamma \)` couples the field to its global average.

Initial conditions are seeded with localized asymmetry—regions of elevated or suppressed entropy—to probe the system’s geometric response. No mass, momentum, or external fields are introduced; curvature arises solely from entropic structure.

M(x, y, z) = \sum_t |\nabla^2 s(x, y, z, t)|

This memory field reveals persistent geometric features and attractor dynamics. Animations are rendered using 3D scatter plots, with color maps encoding scalar intensity and curvature memory.

All simulations are implemented in Python using NumPy and Matplotlib, and executed in Google Colab for reproducibility. Parameters are tuned to highlight directional emergence, oscillatory behavior, and structural coherence.

Static Curvature Hotspots

We begin with a static snapshot of the curvature field, computed from a scalar lattice seeded with localized entropy asymmetry. No animation is applied—this is the immediate geometric response of the system at `\( t = 0 \)`, before any evolution.

The resulting visualization shows discrete red hotspots—regions of elevated Laplacian magnitude—clustered around the initial entropy wells. These curvature zones are not uniformly distributed; they form spatially coherent structures that reflect the seeded asymmetry.

This frame establishes a baseline: curvature can emerge from information structure alone. It confirms that entropy gradients are sufficient to generate localized curvature, even in the absence of motion, mass, or external fields.

![Figure 6: Static Curvature Hotspots](Figures/Figure_6.PNG)
Static curvature hotspots at `\( t = 0 \)`, arising from seeded entropy asymmetry. High-curvature regions cluster around entropy wells, forming spatially coherent structures.

Gradient Evolution

This animation introduces temporal dynamics into the lattice, allowing entropy gradients to evolve under the Laplacian update rule. The initial configuration—visible in the left frame—shows a sparse, structured field of entropy vectors, color-coded by magnitude. As the simulation progresses (right frame), the field becomes more expressive: vectors cluster, elongate, and reorient, revealing emergent curvature patterns.

The transition illustrates how entropy wells act as attractors, organizing nearby curvature into coherent structures. The color gradient (yellow to red) encodes curvature intensity, while vector orientation reflects directional flow. The lattice begins to exhibit motion—not random, but entropically choreographed.

This phase demonstrates that curvature is not static—it propagates, interacts, and self-organizes. The animation reveals how local entropy gradients seed global geometric behavior, setting the stage for directional curvature and memory accumulation in later diagnostics.

![Figure 7: Gradient Evolution(Figures/Figure_7.PNG)
Composite frames from Gradient Evolution (anime2). Left: initial entropy configuration. Right: evolved curvature field showing clustering and directional flow.

Directional Curvature

This diagnostic introduces polarity into the curvature field. Red and blue markers encode directional behavior—expansion and contraction—revealing how entropy gradients not only generate curvature, but orient it.

The composite image below shows six sequential frames from the simulation. Early steps reveal a diffuse scatter of red and blue spheres distributed across the lattice. As the simulation progresses, these regions sharpen and stabilize. Clusters emerge where expansion dominates (red), while contraction zones (blue) form coherent counterweights. The lattice begins to exhibit oscillatory structure, as if breathing through entropic tension.

This behavior suggests that curvature is not merely scalar—it has directionality. The red–blue polarity reflects local divergence in the entropy field, hinting at a deeper geometric logic. Expansion zones repel, contraction zones attract, and the interplay between them drives the lattice’s emergent dynamics.

![Figure 8: Directional Curvature](Figures/Figure-8.PNG)

Curvature Memory

This diagnostic reveals the lattice’s ability to accumulate geometric history. Rather than visualizing instantaneous curvature, we sum the Laplacian field over time, producing a memory map of persistent curvature zones.

The composite image below shows six sequential frames from the simulation, spanning from Step 0 to Step 49. Early frames show sparse, low-intensity curvature, while later frames reveal concentrated hotspots—regions where curvature repeatedly accumulates. These are not transient fluctuations; they are entropic scars, etched into the lattice by sustained gradient activity.

The color gradient (dark purple to bright yellow) encodes curvature intensity, with yellow zones marking long-lived geometric structure. These persistent regions often align with entropy wells, suggesting a feedback loop between information structure and curvature memory.

This behavior suggests that the lattice encodes not just momentary curvature, but a geometric memory of its entropic evolution. These hotspots may act as attractors or scaffolds for future dynamics, hinting at a deeper temporal logic within the system.

![Figure 9: Curvature Memory](Figures/Figure_9.PNG)

Scalar Field

This diagnostic visualizes the scalar field `\( s \)` directly, revealing the entropy landscape that seeds curvature. The composite image below shows six sequential frames from the simulation, capturing the evolution of entropy wells and gradient structure over time.

Early frames show a diffuse distribution of scalar values, with low contrast and minimal clustering. As the simulation progresses, entropy wells deepen and sharpen—visible as bright yellow clusters surrounded by cooler tones. These wells act as attractors, organizing curvature and driving the dynamics observed in previous diagnostics.

The color gradient (blue to yellow) encodes scalar intensity, with yellow regions marking high-entropy zones. These regions often align with curvature hotspots and memory scars, confirming the tight coupling between entropy and geometry.

This diagnostic grounds the entire modelling arc: it reveals the informational substrate from which curvature emerges, evolves, and accumulates.

Overlay: Scalar Field + Curvature Memory

This final diagnostic overlays the scalar field `\( s \)` with the accumulated curvature memory, revealing how entropy wells and geometric scars co-localize. The composite image below shows six sequential frames from the simulation, illustrating the convergence of informational and geometric structure.

Bright yellow regions mark high-entropy zones, while surrounding halos encode persistent curvature. These halos are not merely reactive—they reflect sustained entropic influence, forming a memory scaffold around each core. The color gradient (dark purple to yellow) encodes both scalar intensity and curvature accumulation, producing a dual-layer visualization.

This overlay confirms the tight coupling between entropy and geometry. Scalar wells seed curvature, curvature accumulates, and memory halos form—creating a feedback loop that drives emergent structure. The lattice now exhibits coherence across time, space, and informational

Formalization and Interpretation

Entropy–Curvature Coupling

The simulations suggest a direct relationship between the scalar field `\( s \)` and emergent curvature `\( \kappa \)`. Specifically, curvature appears to arise from the Laplacian of entropy:

```blockmath
\kappa(x, y, z, t) \sim \nabla^2 s(x, y, z, t)
Regions of high entropic divergence induce geometric deformation. In directional diagnostics (Section 3.3), the sign of `\( \kappa \)` encodes polarity—expansion versus contraction—while its magnitude reflects curvature intensity.

Memory Accumulation

To capture persistent geometric structure, we define the curvature memory field `\( M \)` as the cumulative sum of curvature over time:

M(x, y, z) = \sum_{t=0}^{T} \kappa(x, y, z, t)


This field reveals long-lived hotspots—entropic scars formed by sustained gradient activity. These regions act as attractors, scaffolding future curvature and organizing the lattice’s temporal evolution.

Scalar–Curvature Overlay

The final diagnostic (Section 3.6) overlays scalar intensity with curvature memory, revealing co-localized structure. We define a coupling field `\( C \)` as:

C(x, y, z) = s(x, y, z, T) \cdot M(x, y, z)

This product field highlights zones of maximal entropic–geometric interaction. Bright entropy cores surrounded by curvature halos suggest a feedback loop: entropy seeds curvature, curvature accumulates, and memory reinforces structure.

Interpretive Summary

Together, these relationships suggest a generative logic for emergent geometry. Entropy gradients sculpt curvature; curvature accumulates into memory; scalar structure and curvature co-localize to form coherent spatial nodes. The lattice evolves not randomly, but through entropic choreography—hinting at a deeper informational substrate beneath spacetime-like behavior.

Implications and Extensions

From Lattice to Geometry

The diagnostics and formalism suggest that curvature is not a primitive—it emerges from entropic asymmetry. This raises a provocative possibility: spacetime itself may be a secondary construct, arising from informational gradients in a discrete substrate. The lattice becomes a toy model for emergent geometry, where curvature is sculpted by entropy rather than imposed by metric structure.

Cosmological Analogies

The behavior of entropy wells and curvature halos evokes cosmological phenomena. Expansion zones resemble inflationary bubbles; contraction zones mirror gravitational collapse. Memory fields echo the persistence of structure in the cosmic web. While the model is minimal, its dynamics hint at a deeper logic—one where information precedes geometry.

Generalization to Higher Dimensions

The current lattice operates in three spatial dimensions. Extending the framework to 4D (with time as an explicit axis) could reveal richer dynamics: wave propagation, causal structure, and emergent locality. The Laplacian formalism generalizes naturally, and directional curvature may encode proto-causal behavior.

Experimental Toy Models

The simplicity of the update rules invites physical analogs. Could entropy-driven curvature be simulated in optical lattices, cellular automata, or neural fields? The scalar–curvature coupling offers a testable hypothesis: curvature should track entropic divergence, and memory should accumulate where gradients persist.

Toward a Unified Framework

This modelling arc suggests a unifying principle: geometry emerges from information. Entropy gradients seed curvature; curvature accumulates into memory; scalar structure organizes space. The lattice becomes a sandbox for exploring this principle—one that may extend beyond toy models into foundational physics.


Conclusion

This paper introduces the Holographic Entropic Spacetime (HES) framework as a toy model for emergent curvature. By simulating entropy dynamics across a discrete microstate lattice, we demonstrate that geometric structure can arise from purely informational principles.

Through six diagnostics, we traced the evolution of curvature from static hotspots to directional flow, memory accumulation, scalar structure, and final synthesis. Each phase revealed a distinct aspect of entropic geometry, culminating in a formal relationship: curvature emerges from the Laplacian of entropy, and memory accumulates through sustained gradients.

The results suggest that curvature is not a fundamental input, but an emergent output of entropic interactions and global coherence. This supports the hypothesis that spacetime may be a macroscopic manifestation of underlying quantum information flows.

While simplified, the HES model opens new avenues for exploring emergent gravity, holographic duality, and quantum upgrades. Future work will extend the framework to incorporate entanglement, Von Neumann entropy, and tensor network embeddings—bringing us closer to a unified theory of spacetime from first principles.

Ultimately, the HES lattice offers more than simulation—it narrates emergence. It invites us to rethink geometry not as a given, but as a story told by entropy. This narrative can be extended across platforms: from outreach animations and interactive notebooks to experimental analogs in cellular automata or neural fields. The model’s visual clarity and modular logic make it a candidate for public engagement, pedagogical tools, and cross-disciplinary dialogue—bridging physics, computation, and philosophy.


Future Directions

• Quantum Information Analogue: Replace Shannon entropy with Von Neumann entropy and implement the lattice as a tensor network (e.g., MERA).
• Formal Gravitational Isomorphism: Establish a mathematical link between the HES Informational Action `\( \mathcal{A} \)` and the Einstein-Hilbert action `\( \mathcal{S}_{\text{EH}} \)`.
• Dimensional and Dynamical Expansion: Extend to 3D lattices and incorporate causal structure or matter-like degrees of freedom.
• Comparative Benchmarking: Compare emergent geometry (e.g., spectral dimension) with causal dynamical triangulations and causal sets.


By bridging entropy, geometry, and emergence, HES offers a new lens on the deep structure of reality. It invites us to ask: what if spacetime is not the canvas, but the consequence?
