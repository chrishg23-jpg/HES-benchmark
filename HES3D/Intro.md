The nature of spacetime remains one of the deepest puzzles in theoretical physics. While General Relativity treats curvature as a geometric response to energy and momentum, and Quantum Mechanics operates on a fixed background, the question of how spacetime itself might emerge from more fundamental principles remains open.

In this work, we present a toy model that simulates directional curvature emergence from local entropy gradients within a discrete lattice. Using a scalar field governed by a Laplacian-driven update rule, we demonstrate that curvature is not only localizable—it is directional, oscillatory, and capable of forming persistent memory structures. 

Our approach is visual, modular, and diagnostic. Through a sequence of six simulations, we reveal how curvature condenses around entropy wells, how expansion and contraction zones propagate, and how the lattice retains a memory of its own geometric history. These behaviors are not imposed—they emerge from simple rules and seeded asymmetry.

This model is not a replacement for existing theories, but a lens: a way to visualize and interrogate the conditions under which spacetime-like behavior can arise. It invites further exploration into the relationship between entropy, curvature, and structure formation in discrete systems.
