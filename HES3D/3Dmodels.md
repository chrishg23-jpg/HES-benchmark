\subsection{Static Curvature Hotspots}

We begin with a static snapshot of the curvature field, computed from a scalar lattice seeded with localized entropy asymmetry. No animation is applied—this is the immediate geometric response of the system at `\( t = 0 \)`, before any evolution.

The resulting visualization shows discrete red hotspots—regions of elevated Laplacian magnitude—clustered around the initial entropy wells. These curvature zones are not uniformly distributed; they form spatially coherent structures that reflect the seeded asymmetry.

This frame establishes a baseline: curvature can emerge from information structure alone. It confirms that entropy gradients are sufficient to generate localized curvature, even in the absence of motion, mass, or external fields.
