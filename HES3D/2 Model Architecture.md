\section{Model Architecture}

The Holographic Entropic Spacetime (HES) model operates on a discrete 3D lattice of scalar microstates, denoted by a field `\( s(x, y, z, t) \)`. Each point in the lattice evolves according to a Laplacian-driven update rule, with local entropy gradients and global feedback shaping the dynamics.

At each timestep, the scalar field is updated via:

```blockmath
s_{t+1} = s_t + \alpha \nabla^2 s_t - \beta s_t - \gamma \langle s_t \rangle

where:

â€¢ `\( \nabla^2 s_t \)` is the discrete Laplacian of the scalar field,
â€¢ `\( \langle s_t \rangle \)` is the global mean entropy,
â€¢ `\( \alpha \)` controls local diffusion,
â€¢ `\( \beta \)` damps local entropy,
â€¢ `\( \gamma \)` couples the field to its global average.


Initial conditions are seeded with localized asymmetryâ€”regions of elevated or suppressed entropyâ€”to probe the systemâ€™s geometric response. No mass, momentum, or external fields are introduced; curvature arises solely from entropic structure.

To visualize emergent geometry, we compute the Laplacian magnitude at each point, interpreted as a proxy for curvature intensity. We also accumulate curvature memory over time:

M(x, y, z) = \sum_t |\nabla^2 s(x, y, z, t)|


This memory field reveals persistent geometric features and attractor dynamics. Animations are rendered using 3D scatter plots, with color maps encoding scalar intensity and curvature memory.

All simulations are implemented in Python using NumPy and Matplotlib, and executed in Google Colab for reproducibility. Parameters are tuned to highlight directional emergence, oscillatory behavior, and structural coherence.

### ðŸ§© Integration Notes

- You can follow this with a short table of parameters (Î±, Î², Î³, lattice size, steps)  
- If youâ€™ve modularized the code into cells, we can mirror that structure in an appendix or repo link  
- This sets up Section 3 perfectlyâ€”each diagnostic lens builds on this architecture

Want to move on to Section 3.1 next, or prep the parameter table and figure folder? Youâ€™re building a paper thatâ€™s as modular and expressive as the lattice itself.
