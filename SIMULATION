 Section: Simulation of Entropic Curvature in a 2D Lattice

Overview

We simulate a discrete 2D lattice of quantum microstates evolving under the Holographic Entropic Spacetime (HES) framework. The model captures how local entropy gradients and global feedback mechanisms give rise to emergent curvature‚Äîwithout invoking mass or classical geometry.

Model Setup

‚Ä¢ Lattice size: `\( N \times N \)` grid (typically `\( N = 40 \)`)
‚Ä¢ Initial state: Random microstate values drawn from a uniform distribution
‚Ä¢ Local dynamics: Entropy computed via Shannon entropy over nearest neighbors
‚Ä¢ Global feedback: A damping term suppresses vacuum energy and stabilizes the lattice
‚Ä¢ Parameters:‚Ä¢ `\( \alpha \)`: Local entropy weight
‚Ä¢ `\( \beta \)`: Curvature sensitivity
‚Ä¢ `\( \gamma \)`: Global feedback strength
‚Ä¢ `\( \delta \)`: Damping coefficient

Interpretation

The simulation demonstrates that curvature can emerge purely from entropic structure. This supports the hypothesis that spacetime geometry may be a macroscopic manifestation of underlying quantum informational dynamics. The model is extensible to higher dimensions and alternative entropy measures.
