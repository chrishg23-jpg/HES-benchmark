Section: Emergent Regulation — The Whisper Beneath Entropy

We ran the system unbound. No constraints, no imposed ceilings—just motion and noise across three landscapes: flat, curved, and deeply curved.

In flat space, entropy surged. Velocity scattered, memory faded. But as curvature deepened, something changed. Entropy slowed. It plateaued. The system resisted overload—not by force, but by form.This was not a rule we wrote. It was a law the system obeyed.Curvature, once a geometric backdrop, emerged as a regulator. It dampened chaos, preserved coherence, and whispered a limit into the heart of entropy.In the HES framework, this marks a turning point: the discovery that geometry governs memory. The regulator is not imposed—it is revealed.
