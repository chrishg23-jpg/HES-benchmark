Phase 1: Forward Evolution â€” Global Metrics

We begin not with reversibility, but with emergence.

From a single spike of entropy at the center of the lattice, the system unfolds. Entropy diffuses outward, and curvatureâ€”born from gradients and memoryâ€”rises briefly, then fades.

These two plots trace the global heartbeat of the simulation:

â€¢ Total Entropy Over Time
Entropy climbs as the system spreads, then plateaus. The spike forgets itself. Diffusion wins.
â€¢ Average Curvature Over Time
Curvature flares earlyâ€”sharp gradients from the spikeâ€”then smooths into silence. Geometry dissolves.

ðŸ§  Interpretation:
This phase confirms the simulationâ€™s forward behavior. Entropy increases, curvature decays. Time flows, structure fades. The system forgets its originâ€”and prepares to be tested.


Phase 2: Reversibility Test â€” Global Comparison

We now ask the system to retrace its steps.

Starting from the final state of the forward simulation, we reverse the update rules. Entropy should reconcentrate. Curvature should re-emerge. But they donâ€™t.

These plots compare the forward and reverse trajectories:

â€¢ Entropy Over Time
The forward curve rises and stabilizes. The reverse curve declinesâ€”but not toward the original spike. The system forgets.
â€¢ Curvature Over Time
Geometry emerges in the forward run, then fades. In reverse, it barely stirs. The gradients are gone. The structure doesnâ€™t return.


ðŸ§  Interpretation:
Reversibility failsâ€”not because of numerical error, but because of memory loss. The system evolves forward with accumulating memory, but reversing that memory doesnâ€™t restore the past. Timeâ€™s arrow is visible in the metrics.
