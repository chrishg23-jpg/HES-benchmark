Phase 1: Forward Evolution â€” Global Metrics

We begin not with reversibility, but with emergence.

From a single spike of entropy at the center of the lattice, the system unfolds. Entropy diffuses outward, and curvatureâ€”born from gradients and memoryâ€”rises briefly, then fades.

These two plots trace the global heartbeat of the simulation:

â€¢ Total Entropy Over Time
Entropy climbs as the system spreads, then plateaus. The spike forgets itself. Diffusion wins.
â€¢ Average Curvature Over Time
Curvature flares earlyâ€”sharp gradients from the spikeâ€”then smooths into silence. Geometry dissolves.


ðŸ§  Interpretation:
This phase confirms the simulationâ€™s forward behavior. Entropy increases, curvature decays. Time flows, structure fades. The system forgets its originâ€”and prepares to be tested.
