Theoretical Framework

The Holographic Entropic Spacetime (HES) framework proposes that spacetime curvature emerges from gradients in entanglement entropy across a discrete lattice of quantum microstates. Rather than treating geometry as a fundamental entity, HES models it as a macroscopic manifestation of underlying informational structure.

Each site in the lattice represents a quantum microstate, locally entangled with its neighbors. The system evolves under two key principles:

1. Local Entropic Dynamics

Entropy is computed using the Shannon entropy over nearest-neighbor configurations. Regions with high entropy reflect strong local entanglement and informational disorder, while low entropy indicates alignment or equilibrium. These gradients encode the “informational tension” across the lattice, analogous to how stress gradients shape a physical membrane.

Mathematically, the local entropy at site `\((x, y)\)` is defined as:

S(x, y) = -\sum_{i} p_i(x, y) \log p_i(x, y)


where `\( p_i(x, y) \)` is the probability distribution over microstates in the local neighborhood of `\((x, y)\)`.

2. Global Feedback Stabilization

To prevent runaway fluctuations and simulate a self-regulating spacetime, a global feedback term is introduced. This term suppresses vacuum energy and promotes stability across the lattice. It acts as a damping mechanism, ensuring that the system evolves toward a low-energy configuration without external constraints.

The feedback is implemented as a global energy term `\( E_{\text{global}} \)` that modulates the update dynamics:

E_{\text{global}}(t) = \gamma \cdot \left( \sum_{x,y} S(x, y, t) \right)^2


where `\( \gamma \)` is a tunable damping coefficient.

3. Curvature from Entropy

To extract curvature, a discrete Laplacian operator is applied to the entropy field `\( S(x, y) \)`, yielding a curvature map `\( C(x, y) \)` that reflects how entropy bends the lattice geometry:

C(x, y) = \nabla^2 S(x, y)


This formulation treats curvature not as a response to mass-energy, but as a direct consequence of entropic structure. It aligns with recent proposals in quantum gravity suggesting that entanglement may be the fabric from which spacetime is woven.

4. Relation to Existing Frameworks

The HES model draws conceptual inspiration from several lines of research:

• Van Raamsdonk’s entanglement-geometry conjecture, which posits that increasing entanglement between regions of space can stitch together geometric connectivity
• Tensor network models such as MERA, which encode spatial geometry in the structure of entanglement graphs
• Jacobson’s thermodynamic derivation of Einstein’s equations, where spacetime dynamics emerge from entropy balance across local horizons


Unlike holographic dualities that rely on bulk-boundary correspondences, HES offers a bottom-up, simulation-driven approach. It isolates the entropic contribution to curvature in a minimalist setting, providing a reproducible testbed for emergent spacetime hypotheses.

5. Limitations and Extensions

While simplified, the HES model captures essential features of entropic geometry. It does not yet include matter fields, causal structure, or quantum dynamics beyond local entropy. However, its modular design allows for future extensions:

• Higher-dimensional lattices
• Alternative entropy measures (e.g., von Neumann entropy)
• Coupling to matter-like degrees of freedom
• Dynamical causal graphs or time-evolving connectivity


By demonstrating that curvature can emerge from entropy alone, HES opens a pathway toward understanding spacetime as an emergent, information-theoretic phenomenon.
