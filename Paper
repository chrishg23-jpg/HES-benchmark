Introduction

The nature of spacetime remains one of the deepest puzzles in theoretical physics. While General Relativity describes gravity as curvature in a geometric manifold, and Quantum Mechanics governs the probabilistic behavior of particles, a unified framework that explains how spacetime itself emerges from quantum principles remains elusive.

Recent advances in quantum information theory suggest that entanglement may play a foundational role in the emergence of spacetime geometry. From tensor networks to holographic dualities, the idea that “geometry is entanglement” has gained traction—but concrete, reproducible models remain rare.

This paper introduces a toy model based on the Holographic Entropic Spacetime (HES) framework, where curvature arises from entropy gradients in a discrete lattice of microstates. The model simulates how local entropic interactions and global feedback dynamics can generate stable geometric structure without invoking mass or classical fields.

We present a reproducible benchmark notebook that visualizes this process, offering a hands-on demonstration of how information structure alone can give rise to curvature. The results support the hypothesis that spacetime may be a macroscopic manifestation of underlying entropic dynamics—and open new avenues for exploring emergent gravity from first principles.


Theoretical Framework

The Holographic Entropic Spacetime (HES) framework proposes that spacetime curvature emerges from gradients in entanglement entropy across a discrete lattice of quantum microstates. Rather than treating geometry as a fundamental entity, HES models it as a macroscopic manifestation of underlying informational structure.

Each site in the lattice represents a quantum microstate, locally entangled with its neighbors. The system evolves under two key principles:

1. Local Entropic Dynamics

Entropy is computed using the Shannon entropy over nearest-neighbor configurations. Regions with high entropy reflect strong local entanglement and informational disorder, while low entropy indicates alignment or equilibrium. These gradients encode the “informational tension” across the lattice, analogous to how stress gradients shape a physical membrane.

Mathematically, the local entropy at site `\((x, y)\)` is defined as:

S(x, y) = -\sum_{i} p_i(x, y) \log p_i(x, y)


where `\( p_i(x, y) \)` is the probability distribution over microstates in the local neighborhood of `\((x, y)\)`.

2. Global Feedback Stabilization

To prevent runaway fluctuations and simulate a self-regulating spacetime, a global feedback term is introduced. This term suppresses vacuum energy and promotes stability across the lattice. It acts as a damping mechanism, ensuring that the system evolves toward a low-energy configuration without external constraints.

The feedback is implemented as a global energy term `\( E_{\text{global}} \)` that modulates the update dynamics:

E_{\text{global}}(t) = \gamma \cdot \left( \sum_{x,y} S(x, y, t) \right)^2


where `\( \gamma \)` is a tunable damping coefficient.

3. Curvature from Entropy

To extract curvature, a discrete Laplacian operator is applied to the entropy field `\( S(x, y) \)`, yielding a curvature map `\( C(x, y) \)` that reflects how entropy bends the lattice geometry:

C(x, y) = \nabla^2 S(x, y)


This formulation treats curvature not as a response to mass-energy, but as a direct consequence of entropic structure. It aligns with recent proposals in quantum gravity suggesting that entanglement may be the fabric from which spacetime is woven.

4. Relation to Existing Frameworks

The HES model draws conceptual inspiration from several lines of research:

• Van Raamsdonk’s entanglement-geometry conjecture, which posits that increasing entanglement between regions of space can stitch together geometric connectivity
• Tensor network models such as MERA, which encode spatial geometry in the structure of entanglement graphs
• Jacobson’s thermodynamic derivation of Einstein’s equations, where spacetime dynamics emerge from entropy balance across local horizons


Unlike holographic dualities that rely on bulk-boundary correspondences, HES offers a bottom-up, simulation-driven approach. It isolates the entropic contribution to curvature in a minimalist setting, providing a reproducible testbed for emergent spacetime hypotheses.

5. Limitations and Extensions

While simplified, the HES model captures essential features of entropic geometry. It does not yet include matter fields, causal structure, or quantum dynamics beyond local entropy. However, its modular design allows for future extensions:

• Higher-dimensional lattices
• Alternative entropy measures (e.g., von Neumann entropy)
• Coupling to matter-like degrees of freedom
• Dynamical causal graphs or time-evolving connectivity


By demonstrating that curvature can emerge from entropy alone, HES opens a pathway toward understanding spacetime as an emergent, information-theoretic phenomenon.


Results and Interpretation

The HES benchmark simulation produces four key outputs: the evolving microstate lattice, the entropy map, the curvature map, and a time-series analysis of global entropy and energy. Together, these results illustrate how entropic structure alone can generate stable curvature in a discrete spacetime model.

1. Microstate Lattice Evolution

The initial lattice consists of randomly assigned microstates, representing a high-entropy, disordered configuration. As the simulation progresses, local entropic interactions and global feedback dynamics smooth the lattice, driving it toward equilibrium.

Interpretation:
This evolution demonstrates that local entropy gradients can self-organize into coherent structure. The system stabilizes without external constraints, suggesting that informational dynamics alone can produce order.

---

2. Entropy Map

The entropy map visualizes the distribution of local entanglement across the lattice. High-entropy regions appear as smooth gradients, while low-entropy zones reflect equilibrium or alignment.

Interpretation:
Entropy acts as a proxy for informational connectivity. The emergence of smooth gradients indicates that entanglement structure can encode geometric features, supporting the hypothesis that spacetime may be woven from entropic relationships.

---

3. Curvature Map

Applying a discrete Laplacian to the entropy field yields a curvature map. This map reveals how entropy gradients bend the lattice geometry, producing warps and folds without invoking mass or classical fields.

Interpretation:
Curvature emerges directly from entropy. This result aligns with the idea that spacetime geometry is not fundamental, but emergent from deeper informational principles. The model provides a concrete, reproducible demonstration of this concept.

4. Time-Series Analysis

The simulation tracks global entropy and energy over time. Entropy stabilizes early, indicating equilibrium, while global energy exhibits damped oscillations due to feedback dynamics.

Interpretation:
The system self-regulates through entropic feedback. The early stabilization of entropy suggests that equilibrium geometry can emerge quickly, while energy oscillations reflect the interplay between local structure and global constraints.

• Entropic gradients can self-organize into stable geometric structure
• Curvature arises from information, not mass
