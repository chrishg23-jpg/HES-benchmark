Introduction: Systems Arc

The Systems Arc explores how informational dynamics evolve across structured environments. Unlike isolated particle tests, these experiments focus on:

• Topology: How spatial structure influences memory, coordination, and collapse.
• Recursion: How systems respond to repeated input—whether they stabilize, amplify, or degrade.
• Curvature: A proxy for structural resilience, tracking how shape persists under transformation.
• Echo Dynamics: Entities emit signals that decay or amplify, revealing systemic thresholds.
• Emergence: Coordination, feedback, and collapse are not imposed—they arise from interaction.


Each act in the arc isolates a principle:

• Act I: Echo Decay and Amplification
• Act II: Feedback and Collapse
• Act III: Coordination Emergence
• (Future Acts): Memory Migration, Systemic Reversibility, Mythic Synchrony…


The arc is modular, reproducible, and annotated—designed to invite collaboration and reveal emergent laws through performance

• Entities: 5 initialized agents with unique coordinates.
• Decay Law: Exponential decay per frame, factor 0.9.
• Echo Signature: `frame_t_decay_s` where t = time step, s = echo strength.
• Recursion Depth: 10 frames, each representing a propagation step.
• Curvature Estimate: Stabilized at 0.06 from frame 1 onward, indicating consistent spatial topology.
• Entity Drift: Linear positional shift per frame (dx = dy = 0.009), preserving relative structure.
• Informational Dynamics:• Echo strength decreased from 1.0 to 0.387.
• Entities maintained coherent drift, suggesting stable propagation.
• Curvature remained invariant, implying resilience of spatial memory under decay.

• Entities: 5 agents initialized with unique coordinates and echo memory.
• Feedback Law: Echo amplified per frame by a gain factor of 1.1.
• Collapse Threshold: Echo strength > 1.5 triggers collapse annotation.
• Recursion Depth: 10 frames, each representing a feedback cycle.
• Curvature Estimate:• Stable at 0.06 during early feedback
• Increased linearly post-collapse, reaching 0.15 by frame 9
• Suggests structural stress under recursive amplification

• Collapse Dynamics:• Echo strength exceeded threshold at frame 4
• All entities entered collapse state simultaneously
• Echo tags switched from `frame_t_echo_s` to `frame_t_collapse_triggered`
• Entity drift continued, but curvature destabilized

• Systemic Insight:• Feedback loops amplify signal beyond sustainable bounds
• Collapse is predictable via echo strength and curvature response
• Recursion depth correlates with curvature escalation

• Movement became coherent and rhythmic

• Curvature Estimate:• Declined from 0.06 to 0.01 over 10 frames
• Suggests increasing structural harmony

• Recursion Depth: 10 frames, each reinforcing synchrony
• Systemic Insight:• Coordination emerged without central control
• Synchrony stabilized both echo and curvature
• Collapse was not the end—it was the prerequisite for rhythm

• Entities: 5 agents initialized with unique coordinates and echo values.
• Migration Law:• Echoes jumped between entities with 30% probability per frame.
• Mutation rate ±0.05 introduced echo variation.

• Lineage Drift:• Entity_3’s echo lineage spread to all others except Entity_1 by frame 6.
• Entity_1 retained lineage_origin_1 until frame 5, then was overtaken.

• Echo Dynamics:• Echo values ranged from 0.916 to 1.018, showing mutation and stabilization.
• Entity_4’s echo peaked at 1.03 before settling.

• Curvature Estimate:• Oscillated gently between 0.06 and 0.07, reflecting adaptive tension.

• Recursion Depth: 10 frames, each tracking echo migration and lineage shift.
• Systemic Insight:• Memory migration leads to lineage convergence.
• Mutation preserves diversity while enabling adaptation.
• Curvature resilience suggests structural tolerance for migratory dynamics.
