Introduction: Systems Arc

The Systems Arc explores how informational dynamics evolve across structured environments. Unlike isolated particle tests, these experiments focus on:

• Topology: How spatial structure influences memory, coordination, and collapse.
• Recursion: How systems respond to repeated input—whether they stabilize, amplify, or degrade.
• Curvature: A proxy for structural resilience, tracking how shape persists under transformation.
• Echo Dynamics: Entities emit signals that decay or amplify, revealing systemic thresholds.
• Emergence: Coordination, feedback, and collapse are not imposed—they arise from interaction.


Each act in the arc isolates a principle:

• Act I: Echo Decay and Amplification
• Act II: Feedback and Collapse
• Act III: Coordination Emergence
• (Future Acts): Memory Migration, Systemic Reversibility, Mythic Synchrony…


The arc is modular, reproducible, and annotated—designed to invite collaboration and reveal emergent laws through performance

• Entities: 5 initialized agents with unique coordinates.
• Decay Law: Exponential decay per frame, factor 0.9.
• Echo Signature: `frame_t_decay_s` where t = time step, s = echo strength.
• Recursion Depth: 10 frames, each representing a propagation step.
• Curvature Estimate: Stabilized at 0.06 from frame 1 onward, indicating consistent spatial topology.
• Entity Drift: Linear positional shift per frame (dx = dy = 0.009), preserving relative structure.
• Informational Dynamics:• Echo strength decreased from 1.0 to 0.387.
• Entities maintained coherent drift, suggesting stable propagation.
• Curvature remained invariant, implying resilience of spatial memory under decay.
